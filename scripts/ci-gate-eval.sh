#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ci-gate-eval.sh — the PURE decision logic behind .github/workflows/ci-gate.yml, extracted so it is
# TESTABLE. ci-gate runs `--self-test` as its FIRST step on every PR, so a regression in this file fails
# ci-gate loudly instead of silently WIDENING the merge gate (the failure mode this file exists to fix).
#
# ★ THE RULE (the header of ci-gate.yml states it too — keep them in sync):
#   Branch protection requires ONLY `ci-gate`, so ci-gate IS the merge gate. Therefore:
#     • EVERY check present on the PR head GATES — it must reach a terminal state and not have failed —
#       EXCEPT the two declared lists below. That includes the SLOW checks (CodeQL / code-scanning /
#       mutation / osv) that the old snapshot logic silently skipped.
#     • ADVISORY: never waited for, never blocks. Only for checks that are advisory BY THEIR OWN
#       WORKFLOW'S DESIGN (a `continue-on-error` that says so), and notification/comment bots. An
#       external check representing a real BUILD/DEPLOY outcome GATES; a notification bot does NOT.
#     • ORCHESTRATION: never waited for, never blocks — ci-gate's own plumbing. ★ Waiting on these is a
#       DEADLOCK: self-heal's `heal` job polls "waiting for ci-gate to conclude", so if ci-gate also
#       waited for heal, both spin to their timeouts and EVERY PR blocks.
#     • An UNCLASSIFIED check gates by default (fail-safe): a new check must be explicitly declared
#       advisory to stop blocking.
#
# Sourced by ci-gate.yml; no `set -e` at top level so sourcing is safe.

# ci_gate_not_ready <runs_json> <required_json> <advisory_json> <orchestration_json> [osv_prefix]
#   -> prints every name ci-gate must still WAIT for (empty = safe to judge).
#   (a) REQUIRED names not yet present+completed  — fail-closed on a check that never registers.
#   (b) [osv_prefix] if set: no completed check whose name starts with it (its name varies by PR type:
#       "scan-pr / osv-scan" when the reusable job runs, "scan-pr" when the caller is skipped).
#   (c) ★ THE FIX: any PRESENT non-advisory/non-orchestration check still running. The old logic broke
#       out as soon as (a) held and judged THAT snapshot, so a slower check (CodeQL/mutation/osv) with
#       conclusion=null was never counted and could fail AFTER ci-gate had already passed.
